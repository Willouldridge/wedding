        <h1>The Ceremony</h1>
        <p>The ceremony will be held at St. Thomas' Church in central Belfast commencing 12:00. There is parking available at the church for those who would like to drive there.</p>
        
        <p>We would like to request that guests respect the venue and avoid taking photography of the ceremony itself.</p>

        <h1>The Reception</h1>
        <p>Our reception will then be held at Ballygally Castle hotel on the north coast. This is about a 40 minute drive from the church. We have organised a coach to take some people from the ceremony to the reception however if you would like to drive there is also parking available at the hotel.</p>

        <p>The reception finishes at 12PM and a return coach to the centre of Belfast has been booked for then. If you would like to travel on the coach in either direction please check the appropriate box on the RSVP form.</p>
