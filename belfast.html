        <h1>Things to do and see</h1>

        <p>There are plenty of exciting things to do in Northern Ireland if you would like to extend your visit into a holiday</p>
        
        <p>Probably the most famous thing to see is the Titanic quarter of Belfast where the Titanic was built. It is hard to miss as you just need to head towards the two giant yellow cranes, affectionately known as "Sampson and Goliath". You can take a tour round one of the boats that ferried guest onto the ship as well as visiting the very worthwhile Titanic Experience which gives a detailed history of the events and context of the time. The studios where a large amound of filming for "Game of Thrones" is also just across the road!</p>
        
        <p>Belfast is also home to the Ulster Museum if you feel like boning up on Northern Irish history.</p>
        
        <p>For those who are keen for wider adventuring there is of course the fabulous Giant's Causeway which, if you are a National Trust member is even free! There are also numerous filming locations for Game of Thrones such as the "Dark Hedges". Locations coach tours operate out of Belfast taking you around the most famous and stunning locations.</p>
        
        <p>If food and drink is more your thing then there are a huge number of restaurants in the area including a string of themed restaurants owned by the chef Michael Deane. These are towards the higher end of the price range and booking is a must but other alternatives are also availale. "Made in Belfast" is a personal favourite offering a great selection of local food and craft beers. "The Perch" is a rooftop coktail bar tucked away near the City Hall and does some delicious drinks.</p>
