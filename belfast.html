        <h1>Things to do and see</h1>

        <p>There are plenty of exciting things to do in Northern Ireland, if you would like to extend your visit into a holiday</p>
        
        <p>One of the best thing to see is the Titanic Quarter. This area is hard to miss as you just need to head towards the two giant yellow shipbuilding cranes that dominate the city's skyline, affectionately known as "Samson and Goliath". Close by, you can go on a tour of The Nomadic (the boat that ferried guests onto the Titanic) and HMS Caroline (the last surviving warship from the Battle of Jutland). The Titanic Centre, which gives a detailed history of the events and context of the time, is also well worth a visit. The studios where a large amound of filming for " Game of Thrones" happens are also just across the road!</p>
        
        <p>In the University Quarter, you will find Queens University, some excellent second hand bookshops and the Ulster Museum.</p>
        
        <p>For those who are keen for wider adventuring, the North Coast is well worth exploring. We reccomend the Giant's Causeway, Bushmills Distillery and the Carrick-A-Rede Rope Bridge. There are also numerous filming locations for Game of Thrones such as the "Dark Hedges" and location coach tours operate out of Belfast taking you around the most famous and stunning places.</p>
        
        <p>If food and drink is more your thing, then there are a huge number of excellent restaurants in Belfast. "Made in Belfast" is a personal favourite in the city centre offering a great selection of local food and craft beers, and Il Pirata, "Belfast's answer to Polpo and Co" situated further out of the city centre in Ballyhackamore . For evening drinks, "The Perch" is a rooftop coktail bar tucked away near the City Hall and has a great atmosphere.</p>
