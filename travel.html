        <h1>By Air</h1>

        <p>The fastest and easiest way to travel to Northern Ireland is to fly.</p>

        <p>There are two airports you could fly to: <b>Belfast International Airport</b> and the <b>George Best Belfast City Airport</b>. Confusingly, the Belfast International Airport is not actually in Belfast and is sometimes referred to as Aldergrove after the village that it is nearby. Both airports are well connected to the city centre with frequent airport shuttle buses. The City Airport is much closer to the city centre!</p>

        <p><b>Easyjet</b> flies frequently from London Stansted, London Gatwick and Glasgow to <b>Belfast International Airport</b>. <b>Ryanair</b> also flies frequently from London Stansted to the <b>International Airport</b>. (If you would like to hire a car when you arrive and have flown with Easyjet, you are entitled to a reduction with the car hire firm Europcar.)</p>

        <p><b>Flybe</b> also operates flights to Belfast and flies directly from Exeter, Leeds Bradford and other locations to the <b>George Best Belfast City Airport</b>.</p>

        <p><b>Belfast International Airport</b> has regular shuttle buses that will transport you directly to the city centre. At peak times, these run every 15 minutes and cost around £11.00 for a return ticket. The airport is around a 35-45 minute journey away from the city centre.</p> 

        <p><b>Belfast City Airport</b> also has a bus link and approved taxis operate from the taxi rank outside the terminal building. The approximate cost of a taxi to Belfast City Centre from Belfast City Airport is around £10.00 and is about a 10-15 minute journey.</p>
        
        <p>Travelling the day/evening before the wedding is a good idea, if you prefer to avoid undue stress from potential delays.</p>
        
        <h1>By Boat</h1>

        <p>Travelling by boat is also a viable option. <b>Stena Line ferries</b> sail between <b>Cairnryan, Scotland</b> and <b>Belfast, Northern Ireland</b> as well as <b>P&amp;O</b> ferries sailing between <b>Cairnryan</b> and <b>Larne</b>. The Liverpool sailing is around 8 hours with a choice of a day or night sailing. The Cairnryan sailing is only 2 hours 15 minutes and crossings run six times a day. You can travel either with a car or as a foot passenger.</p>
