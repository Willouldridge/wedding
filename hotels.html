        <h1 style="text-align:center;">Hotel Recommendations</h1>
        <h1>In Belfast</h1>
        <p>There are plenty of options for accommodation in Belfast, particularly in the city centre. We recommend just a few here, but strongly advise if you are finding your own hotel, that it is in Central or South Belfast. If you have any questions, please just get in touch! </p>
        
        <p>The following hotels are all right in the city centre and within walking distance of each other, some great restaurants and the airport shuttle bus stop. They will also be nearby if you are being dropped back to Belfast by the wedding bus at the end of the evening.</p>

        <p><a href="http://www.easyhotel.com/hotels/united-kingdom/belfast/101977"> Easyhotel</a></p>
        <p><a href="http://www.travelodge.co.uk"> The Travelodge (Brunswick Street)</a></p>
        <p><a href="http://www.jurysinns.com/hotels/belfast">Jury's Inn</a></p>
        <p><a href="http://www.theflinthotel.com/">The Flint</a> is a new hotel in the city centre which is made up of individual ‘suites’. Some suites have kitchen facilities available.</p>
        <p>If you are looking for something luxurious at the higher end of the price range, <a href="http://www.hastingshotels.com/europa-belfast/">The Europa</a>, <a href="http://www.grandcentralhotelbelfast.com">The Grand Central Hotel</a> and the <a href="http://www.themerchanthotel.com/">The Merchant</a> are all particularly good options.</p>

        <p>Alternatively, the <a href="http://www.malonelodgehotelbelfast.com/">Malone Lodge Hotel</a> is the closest hotel to St. Thomas’ Church. It is situated further out from the city centre, in South Belfast, and is a one minute walk from the church. It also offers one-bedroom to three-bedroom apartments known as ‘Malone Mews’ and they are extremely close to the church.</p>

        <h1>Near the Reception</h1>
        <p>You may wish to stay overnight in <a href="http://www.hastingshotels.com/ballygally-castle/">The Ballygally Castle Hotel</a> after the wedding. It is in a stunning location, close to plenty of Game of Thrones filming spots and on the beautiful Causeway Coast route. It is an excellent base for exploring more of what Northern Ireland has to offer. If you would like to stay here, there are special accommodation rates available upon booking. Please quote “Mary and Will’s Wedding”.</p>
        
        <p> <a href="http://www.thehalfwayhousehotel.com/">The Halfway House</a> is a two minute walk away from The Ballygally Castle Hotel and is also a great location for exploring the coast.</p>

        <p>Finally, there are also four-star self-catering holiday apartments available in Ballygally itself. For more information look at: <a href="http://www.ballygallyapartments.com">www.ballygallyapartments.com</a></p>
